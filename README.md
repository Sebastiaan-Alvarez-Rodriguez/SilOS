# SilOS
Once upon a time, in some dentist center, there was a great need for a wizard. 
A wizard, who could remember all items in a room, 
who knew where each and every product came from,
who could see by a mere barcode what product was meant.

The dentist-folk knew that if they had modern enough Android phones (API >=27, aka android version >= 8.1),
they could summon this wizard into their realm.
